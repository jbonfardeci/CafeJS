*
*	Usage:
*	//include as many asynchronous functions as you need to execute in sequence
*	var cafe = new Cafe(function(cafe, args){ }, function(cafe, args){ }, function(cafe, args){ });
*	cafe.cascade();

function Cafe(/*array:*/fns){

Cafe.prototype = {	
	/* handles execution of async functions in this.fns */
	cascade: function(){

		if(this.fns.length == 0){ return false; }
		
		/* execute the next function passing 'this' and any arguments from the previous function */
		this.fns.shift()(this, arguments);
